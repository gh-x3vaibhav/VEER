## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- CUDA-compatible GPU (Minimum: NVIDIA RTX 3050 or better)
- Unity 2022.3 or later (for Unity components)
- Unreal Engine 5.0 or later (for Unreal Engine components)
- Modern web browser (for web visualization)
- VR Headset (for VR features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VEER.git
cd VEER
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. For Game Engine components:
- Unity: Open the Unity project in `Realm_Processor/Unity_plugin/UnityGaussianSplatting`
- Unreal Engine: Open the Unreal project in `Realm_Processor/Unreal_plugin`
- Install required packages through respective Package Managers
- Install Gaussian Splatting application: Run `3D_Constructor/Gaussian Splatting/gaussian-splatting-app/Postshot-BETA-0.3.203.exe` for instant Gaussian Splat creation

4. For VR components:
- Install VR SDKs for your target platform (Oculus, SteamVR, etc.)
- Configure VR settings in your preferred game engine
- Set up VR input devices and controllers

5. Running the Project:
- Try running the main script first:
```bash
python main.py
```
- If main.py doesn't work (as it's still in development), you can run each module manually following the instructions in the Usage section below.

## 💻 Usage

### 3D Generation
```bash
# Generate 3D objects using GAN
python 3D_Constructor/GAN/3D-IWGAN/3D-Generation/32-3D-IWGan.py

# Train NeRF model
python 3D_Constructor/NeRF/NGP/train.py --data_path <your_data_path>
```

### Point Cloud Processing
```bash
# Clean point clouds
python 3D_Enhancer/pointcleanner/clean.py --input <input_file> --output <output_file>

# Remove noise
python 3D_Enhancer/pointcleanner/denoise.py --input <input_file> --output <output_file>
```

### Visualization
- Web Viewer: Open `Realm_Processor/Web_view/main2/index.html` in a web browser
- Unity Viewer: Open the Unity project and load your 3D models
- Unreal Viewer: Open the Unreal Engine project and import your 3D models
- VR Viewer: Launch VR mode in either Unity or Unreal Engine
